# New tabs at end

I like new tabs to be opened at the end of the tab list and for a long
time I've used the [New Tabs At End](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tabs-at-end/bgogjfbkjgjhonhikkkflpkgpcpfljoa)
plugin by itworks.

It doesn't appear to be maintained and as of Chromium 91 the tab
tracking doesn't work properly, resulting in the wrong tab being made
active when closing tabs.

This is version 2.0.3.3 from the Chrome Web Store with the following
changes:

- removal of metadata/signatures
- removal of Google Analytics
- fix tab tracking and tab selection on tab close
